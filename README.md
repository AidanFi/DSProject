# Data Structures Project
#### Timer.hpp = timer class header file. Used to determine how long a program takes to run.
#### matrix.cpp = contains Matrix class with functions to create matrices, return number of rows and columns, and return values at any given point in the matrix. Each object in this class is two vectors of type int.
#### matrixAddition.cpp = program to add two 3X3 matrices + tell time taken using Timer class. 
#### matrixAddition.cu = same program as matrixAddition.cpp, but run with the cuda compiler. Runs slightly faster due to parallelism of cuda.
